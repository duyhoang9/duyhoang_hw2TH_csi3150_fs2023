        Hello, my name is Duy Hoang. I am a senior studying computer science and
        currently have a job at Bosch as a software developer. I have a lot of
        expereience creating web pages and hosting servers, which is what I do
        at work. Along with debugging code in Python and joining a ton of
        meetings. I really do not like computers, hardware and software, I just
        went into computer science because it rapidly growing and has a good
        work life balance. If you want to know more about my life, I suggest you

        <a href="html/my_resume.html">My Resume</a> and
        <a href="html/my_fun_facts.html">Some Fun Facts</a>.
