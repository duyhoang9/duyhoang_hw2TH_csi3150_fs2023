      <!-- The amazing movie Oppenheimer directed by Christopher Nolan is based off this book -->
      <p>
        American Prometheus is a biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the
        scientist who led the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. The
        book explores his life, his achievements, his struggles, and his legacy.
        It also examines the moral and political implications of his work, and
        how he faced the consequences of scientific progress. The title refers
        to the Greek myth of Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods and was
        punished for it.

      <h2>Favorite Audio Track</h2>
      <audio src="../audio/KneeSocks.mp3" controls></audio>
      <!-- Used a Youtube to mp3 converter -->
      <p>
        This is a song from the Arctic Monkey's band, called "Knee Socks". It is
        from their album AM, which is also the favicon.

      <p>
        This is a clip of the ending of the movie La La Land, directed by Damien
        Chazelle. It is a love story between actors Ryan Gostling and Emma
        Stone, which doesn't have the typical happy ending. I have actaully been
        to the areas in Los Angeles where this movie is filmed.
